### How to use the Injector

In order for the injector to work, you need to put two compiled [Guided Hacking injector library](https://github.com/Broihon/GH-Injector-Library) files inside the output directory.  
Rename them as follows:  

The Injector dll file:
"Injector.dll"

The Injector SM file:
"GH Injector SM - x64.exe"
